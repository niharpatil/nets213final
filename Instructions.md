# How you can contribute to Crowdoddity
For this project we created 3 Hits on mechanical turk which can be done in the usual manner on Mechanical Turk:

## Hit 1: 
For the first hit weâ€™re looking for areas which Turkers have significant knowledge in. This means just as the instructions say submit a few areas where you might be able to make a prediction about the outcome of a future event.

## Hit 2: 
This hit is part of aggregating the possible subject areas from the first hit. We used word2Vec to see which subjects may be related but we want Turker feedback on how accurate these connections were.

## Hit 3:
This is the hit for actually getting predictions from Turkers. Select the area which you feel you might have the most knowledge in and simply make your prediction for which outcome you believe is correct as well as suggesting the distribution of Turkers who will select each option.
